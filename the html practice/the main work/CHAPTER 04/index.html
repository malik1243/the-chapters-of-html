    <h3><ins>LINKS</ins></h3>

    <p>In this chapter we are going to learn about how to make the links between the pages and giving the links
        between different websites.
    </p>

    <h3><ins>For example</ins></h3>

    <p>In order to create the link we use the shortcvut word using 'a' and it creates the address for the link 
        and after that the link is created.
    </p>
    <p>so we are going to show the simple example.</p>

    <p>here's the link for the google chrome.</p>

    <a href="https:google.com">go to google chrome</a>
    <br>
